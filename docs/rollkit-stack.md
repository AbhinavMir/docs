# The Rollkit Stack

This section will cover the dependencies and customizeable components of Rollkit.

Roll-up sequencer nodes collect transactions from users, aggregate them into blocks, and post the blocks onto Celestia (or other DA layer) to be ordered and finalized. Full nodes execute and verify roll-up blocks, and propagate fraud-proofs when needed. Light clients receive headers, verify fraud proofs, and can authenticate trust-minimized queries about the state.

For an understanding of the Rollkit stack, let's first look at the key components of a rollup. A typical rollup has:

## Rollup Application Dependencies

* Requires Golang version 1.19+

## Mempool

<!-- Drafting: a mempool for queing up transactions - Manav -->

The mempool keeps the set of pending transactions, and is used by block
producers (full nodes) to produce blocks. Transactions are handled by
nodes in the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) manner. Ordering of transactions
can be implemented on the application level (for example by adding
nonce/sequence number). This behaviour is similar to the Tendermint mempool.

## State Fraud Proofs

## P2P-Layer

Rollkit's P2P layer enables direct communication between rollup nodes.
It's used to gossip transactions, headers of newly created blocks and state fraud proofs.
The P2P layer is implemented using [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p).

Rollkit uses [DHT-based active peer discovery](https://curriculum.pl-launchpad.io/curriculum/libp2p/dht/).
Starting a node connects to preconfigured bootstrap peers, and advertises it's namespace ID in DHT.
This solution is flexible, because multiple rollup networks may reuse the same DHT/bootstrap nodes,
but specific rollup network might decide to use dedicated nodes as well.

## Rollkit Node Types

### Sequencer node

Some roll-ups utilize _sequencer nodes_. Sequencers are the main block producers for rollups, respoonsible for aggregating transactions into blocks, and typically executing transactions to produce a state root, securing the rollup's light clients.

Rollkit plans to support multiple different pluggable sequencer schemes:

### Full node

Full nodes verify all blocks and can produce fraud proofs for optimistic rollups. Since they fully validate all rollup blocks, they don't rely on fraud or validity proofs for security.

### Light node

Light nodes are light-weight rollup nodes that authenticate block headers, and are secured by fraud proofs or validity proofs. They're recommended for average users on low-resource devices. Users running light nodes can make trust-minimized queries about the rollup's state.
